- Artifact Evaluated Functional: The artifacts and the sources from where they originate are available and documented for experimenting.
- Artifacts Available Results Validated Available: The artifacts are available via Zenodo which in turn is connected to a GitHub repository, following the open science guidelines.
-Artifacts Available Results Validated Replicated: The main results, i.e., the queries generated by the semantic translator of the KPI Engine can be replicated using the provided script "replicate.sh".
Apart from the changes in the time windows parameters of the queries because of the difference between the time when the paper results were executed and the replicated experiments, 
the query expressions are the same as the ones presented in the results section and folder of the archive.
