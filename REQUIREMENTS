As for the requirements to replicate the setup described in the case study, one only needs docker that is called from a bash script under scripts/reproduce.sh (Linux/Unix compatible).
The script uses the CLI version of docker as it has a setup stage that is required to fetch a folder to be mounted as a volume in one of the container images used.
The data platform prototype and additional implemented services are run via docker-compose. Then after some metrics are generated from the platform execution, 
the KPI Engine is also launched using docker to perform the semantic translation between the instantiated models and the Prometheus toolkit.

For docker-compose installation scenarios: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#installation-scenarios.
In general, the docker Desktop version should have both the docker engine and the docker-compose installed and those can be used in terminal via the CLI.

Summary of Requirements:
- OS: Linux/Unix
- Environment: Docker - Docker Engine CLI with Docker Compose Plugin.
- Launch: Bash script
