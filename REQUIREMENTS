As for the requirements to replicate the setup described in the case study, one only needs docker.
More specifically, the data platform prototype and additional implemented services are run via docker-compose. Then after some metrics are generated from the platform execution, 
the KPI Engine is also launched using docker to perform the semantic translation between the instantiated models and the Prometheus toolkit.

For docker-compose installation scenarios: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#installation-scenarios.
In general, the docker Desktop version should have both the docker engine and the docker-compose installed.
